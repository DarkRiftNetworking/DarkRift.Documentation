# Dark Guide

Welcome to the %DarkRift User Guide, or the "Dark Guide" for short!

%DarkRift 2 is a high performance/low overhead low level C# networking engine, that efficiently implements C# asynchronous sockets to enable multithread processing of received messages.

You can create classic client-server applications with either authoritative or non-authoritative servers, or even serverless peer-to-peer, applicable to realtime as well as asynchronous games.
