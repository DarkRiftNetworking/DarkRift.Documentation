# Internal Plugins
A number of plugins, logwriters and network listeners come pre-packaged inside DR and are automatically loaded. This section provides individual documentation for many of them.

These plugins can all be administered, as any other plugin of that type can be with configuration, for example:
```xml
<plugins>
  <plugin type="HttpHealthCheck" load="false" />
</plugins>
```
