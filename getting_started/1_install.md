# Install
In this section we will work through downloading and installing DarkRift.

Create a new Unity project and go to the Unity Asset store, search DarkRift and click download. It will ask you which parts you want to import, just import everything for now.

In the root folder of your project there will now be a zip file entitled DarkRift server, extract it somewhere outside of the Unity project (e.g. your desktop).

Note: If you extract it inside the Unity project, Unity will throw a lot errors because there will be library files with the same name in the project, so don’t do that.

If you haven’t already, now’s a great time to have a look at the demo projects included in DarkRift and get a feel for how to use the server.
